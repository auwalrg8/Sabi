# Breez SDK Implementation Analysis - Sabi Wallet

## SDK Package Used
- **`breez_sdk_spark_flutter`** - v0.13.4 (latest from main as of April 2026) - Nodeless Lightning + Spark with **Stable Balance** support.

**New: Stable Balance Feature**
- Configured with USDB token for USD-stable balance.
- Automatic conversion on receive (sats → USDB when threshold met) and send (USDB → sats if needed).
- Opt-in via user settings toggle for clean UX.
- Protects against BTC volatility while keeping non-custodial control.

---

**Clean UX/UI Flow Added**
- Toggle in wallet home screen (beautiful card with animation, modal explanation using wolt_modal_sheet, live rates).
- Dual balance display (BTC + Stable USD).
- Smooth transitions and educational onboarding.

## 📂 Implementation Categories

### 1. Core SDK Infrastructure
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `lib/services/breez_spark_service.dart` | Main wrapper service - handles all SDK operations |
| `lib/services/breez_api_key_service.dart` | API key management (Cloudflare Worker + local override) |
| `lib/core/extensions/config_extensions.dart` | SDK config class extensions |
| `lib/main.dart` | App initialization with `BreezSdkSparkLib.init()` |

---

### 2. Wallet Management
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time via `balanceStream` with 3-second polling
- **Wallet Creation**: Mnemonic generation + `initializeSparkSDK()`
- **Wallet Recovery**: Import mnemonic via `initializeSparkSDK(mnemonic: ...)`
- **Providers**: `breezBalanceProvider`, `walletInfoProvider`, `breezInitializerProvider`

### 3. Lightning Payments

| Feature | SDK Methods Used |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Send Payments** | `prepareSendPayment()`, `sendPayment()` |
| **Create Invoices** | `receivePayment()` with `ReceivePaymentRequest` |
| **Lightning Addresses** | `registerLightningAddress()`, `getLightningAddress()`, `checkLightningAddressAvailable()` |
| **Transaction History** | `listPayments()`, `paymentStream` |

---

### 4. Payment Notifications
- `lib/services/breez_webhook_bridge_service.dart` - Firebase push notifications
- `lib/services/payment_notification_service.dart` - Local notifications
- Uses `paymentStream` to detect incoming payments and trigger alerts

---

### 5. Fiat On/Off Ramp & P2P Trading
- **Invoice Creation** for fiat-to-BTC conversion
- **TapNob Integration** for off-ramp via `sendPayment()`
- **P2P Trade Escrow** using Lightning invoices

---

### 6. VTU Services (Airtime/Data/Bills)
- Balance check via `getBalance()`
- Payment execution via `sendPayment()` + `createInvoice()`

---

### 7. Nostr Zaps Integration
- Zap payments through `sendPayment()`
- LNURL-pay resolution for zap requests

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Singleton Pattern** | All SDK calls routed through `BreezSparkService` |
